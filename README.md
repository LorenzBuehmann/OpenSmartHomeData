## The Data

The data set comprises static and dynamic building data. 

MeasurementTurtle - RDF dump of the measurements made using a real world smart home system as RDF dumps in ttl format
00_OpenSmartHomeData.ttl - Meta data describing the observations made by the smart home system measurements
01_LinkOshAndRevit.ttl - Links linking instances from 00_OpenSmartHomeData.ttl and 02_BotFromRevit.ttl
02_BotFromRevit.ttl - Bot export from Revit file (05_Flat.rvt)
03_GEOM.ttl - GEOM export generated from the IFC file (04_Flat.ifc)
04_Flat.ifc - IFC model of the flat exported from Revit
05_Flat.rvt - Model of the flat in Revit
